This is a simple program to control dancing USB toys manufactured by
"Dream Cheeky", they were produced somewhere around 2007 and identify
themselves as 1941:8021. I only tested the one named "USB dancing
robot".

ctlrobot does all the actual work. You'll need libusb and some basic
development tools installed to compile it, but assuming you have that
typing "make" should do the trick. 

To control the toy you can supply two arguments, the first one controls
the actual movement, the latter additional LEDs. Both arguments accept
"off" to disable movement/blinking, "slow" for slow movement and normal
blinking or "fast" for fast movement and double-flash blinking.

As long as you havn't modified your udev-rules this software only works
as root.

Completly untested udev template:

/etc/udev/rules.d/10-robot.rules
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendors}=="1941", ATTRS{idProduct}=="8021", GROUP="users", MODE="0666"
